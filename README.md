# RUSHPRO: Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) RUSH Training Study

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for the analysis and visualization of data related to the paper titled "Teaching Medical Students Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension (RUSH): Learning Outcomes and Clinical Performance"

## Abstract

**Background:** Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a critical diagnostic tool in various medical settings, yet its instruction in medical education is inconsistent. The Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension (RUSH) protocol is a comprehensive diagnostic tool, but its complexity poses challenges for teaching and learning. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a single-day RUSH training for medical students, assessing their performance in clinical scenarios.

**Methods:** In this prospective single-center observational study, 16 medical students from Saarland University Medical Center underwent a single-day RUSH training, followed by evaluations in clinical settings and on simulators. Performance was assessed using a standardized scoring tool and time to complete the RUSH exam. Knowledge gain was measured with pre- and post-training quizzes, and diagnostic performance was evaluated with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).

**Results:** Students demonstrated high performance in RUSH exam views on patients (median performance: 84--87%) and improved scanning times, although not statistically significant. They performed better on simulators than on live patients. Quiz scores significantly improved post-training, indicating a gain in theoretical knowledge. However, more than a third of students could not complete the RUSH exam within the clinically relevant time frame on live patients.

**Conclusion:** Single-day RUSH training improved medical students' theoretical knowledge and simulator performance but translating these skills to clinical settings proved challenging. The findings suggest that while short-term training can be beneficial, it may not suffice for clinical proficiency. This study underscores the need for structured and possibly longitudinal training programs to ensure skill retention and clinical applicability.
